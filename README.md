The project implements floating-point operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 

The testbench verifies the module by reading test cases from `testcase.txt`.

The `testcase.txt` file is generated by `testcase.py`. You can modify this script to test specific operations.

We tested our project with 100 randomly generated test cases.  
Each number is randomly chosen from the range **-10 to 10**, with fractional parts being powers of 2.
